            Hi there! My name is Josh but some of my friends call me Lilac. I moved to Salt Lake for school in 2017 where I studied Philosophy and Mathematics at the University of Utah. After receiving my degree I worked in the outdoor industry for a while, then transitioned to the service industry. This is where I currently am. I decided to enroll in the coding bootcamp to increase my skillset and hopefully make myself more marketable for jobs. In my free time, I enjoy ceramics, skateboarding, reading, and watching films.
